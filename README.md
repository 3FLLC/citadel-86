This is the source and binaries for the Citadel-86 BBS system version 3.45 for
MS-DOS, obtained from here: http://jupiter.okb-1.org:8880/wiki/Citadel-86

Aside from this README, all files are original.

Contents:

* `read.me` - README from Hue, Jr. for the v3.45 source release.
* `dist` - C-86 v3.45 binary release for MS-DOS.
* `port` - Main Citadel source.
* `sysdep` - MS-DOS-specific Citadel source.
* `man` - Citadel-86 manuals for v3.40.

The release date appears to have been 1993-07-05, although some of the source
files in the archive are as recent as 1994-01-16.  The v3.40 manuals are dated
1992-04-14.

See the `read.me` file from Hue, Jr. for more information about the source.
See `install3.man` for installation instructions.

This repo is for historical purposes, since C-86 seems to have been largely
lost to the mists of time, and information about it is difficult to find on
the Web.  There appears to have been at least one more version (v3.46) but the
files have disappeared...
